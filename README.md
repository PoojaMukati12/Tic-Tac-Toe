# Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸŽ®

Developed Tic-Tac-Toe,a game where two players take turns making spaces in a 3x3 grid.

The game is typically played with X and O symbols, where one player uses X, and the other uses O.

The goal is to be the first player to place three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

I built this game by using Javascript and React.JS.
